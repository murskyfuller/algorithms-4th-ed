_1.1.11_ - Write a code fragment that prints the contents of a two-dimensional boolean array, using * to represent true and a space to represent false. Include row and column numbers.

_1.1.9_ - Write a code fragment that puts the binary representations of a positive integer n into a string s.

_1.1.5_ - Write a code fragment that prints true if the double variables x and y are both strictly between 0 and 1 and false otherwise.
